I want starting and stopping points for my EField. I also want n number of points. And I want the point values of the EField to be exponentially increasing. How to accomplish this?

The very first question to ask is where the cross section data starts and stops. That's not a straightforward question. Cross sections are a function of the electron energy. For a given electric field, electrons will have a distribution of energy. 

Most straightforward way is to use Jannis's starting and stopping electric fields and his # of points. Well that's easy...he has 100 points.

Starting EField: 2.414323855084169554e+04
Stopping EField: 3.380053397117837518e+07
